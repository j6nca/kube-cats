# kube-cats

A fun kubernetes visualizer with pixel cats! 🐱

> [!NOTE] 
> This project is meant just for fun and should not be used in place of any monitoring/metrics tooling.

## Goals

- [ x ] display various components of the cluster in a read-only, fun, form factor
- [ ] semi-randomized asset usage (different combinations of cats)
- [ ] special cases (based off pod health, etc.)
